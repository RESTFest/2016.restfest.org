        <p>
One of REST's constraints is that of a uniform interface. Web technologies as they exist today also highlight the fact that the uniform interface from 20 years ago is not quite as uniform anymore. This talk presents an overview of the various axes of the uniform interface and will introduce a resource intended to provide an overview of the constantly evolving set of Web concepts.</p>

      <h3 class="ui header">Keynote, Speakers, Schedule</h3>
      <p>REST Fest is a unique blend of presentations and collaborative unconference goodness.
      The keynote sits directly in the middle of the conference schedule with hackday,
      workshop, session, talks, and 5-in-5 lightening talks surrounding it.</p>
